    <p>
        <h6>Billing</h6>. Upon my soul, it's true; you find you are not done till you<br>
have pulled all the old rubbish down.<br></p>
<p>
<h6>Aslaksen</h6> [coming in]. Pulled down? You are not thinking of pulling down<br>
the Baths surely, Doctor?<br></p>
<p>
<h6>Hovstad</h6>. Far from it, don't be afraid.<br></p>
<p>
<h6>Dr. Stockmann</h6>. No, we meant something quite different. Well, what do<br>
you think of my article, Mr. Hovstad?<br></p>
<p>
<h6>Hovstad</h6>. I think it is simply a masterpiece.<br></p>
<p>
<h6>Dr. Stockmann</h6>. Do you really think so? Well, I am very pleased, very<br>
pleased.<br></p>
<p>
<h6>Hovstad</h6>. It is so clear and intelligible. One need have no special<br>
knowledge to understand the bearing of it. You will have every<br>
enlightened man on your side.<br></p>
<p>
<h6>Aslaksen</h6>. And every prudent man too, I hope?<br></p>
<p>
Billing. The prudent and the imprudentâ€”almost the whole town.<br>
